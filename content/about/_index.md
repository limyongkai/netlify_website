Hi! I'm Yong Kai, a student pursing my Master of IT in Business at Singapore Management University. Prior to venturing into the world of analytics and data science, I worked in the engineering industry as a Project Engineer and a Sales Engineer. The analytic and problem solving skill set as an engineer translated well as an aspiring data scientist. My strength lies in analyzing and transforming complex data into powerful visuals and information with actionable insights based on domain knowledge.


I am currently interning at Ministry of Health dealing with COVID-19, but will be looking for full time employment in the data science field from quarter 2 of 2022.
